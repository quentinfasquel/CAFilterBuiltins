# CAFilterBuiltins
Exposes Appleâ€™s private CAFilter class through a Swift wrapper (_CAFilter), providing an API similar to CoreImage.CIFilterBuiltins but for Core Animation filters. Includes utilities for easier usage of CAFilters in Swift, with plans to expand into an exhaustive list of available filters.
